# Summary of this weeks lessons
## Day 1 - JS Basics 
Strings are a string of characters. " - "; ` - `; ' - ';
Nulls = Object NaN = not a number
Ways to declare variables using Let (can change it's value) | Const (does not change).
Console.log for sanity checks.
Push - ADD | Pop - REMOVE
Arrays are like UL LI in HTML.
Build an array of objects and put a function inside of your object.
Functions | code that can be reused.
## Day 2
.this Keyword refers to object itself.
Keywords are the same color in JS.
Methods are functions inside of objects.
Use "this" to create multiple functions or multiple objects then call the function.
When using Peramiters, stick to the basics.
innertext | innerHTML | textcontent = has same values.
Use class on elements.
" > " means direct child of elements using queryselector. 
To use document.queryselector on an ID use # instead of .
Queryselectorall to get a list to iterate over, NOT an array a NODE list.
## Day 3
When promise pending shows in console, await your response.
Call an function using arrow functions the same way using .then.
Fetch returns a promise.
Async takes time to execute.
Promise is a data type of an object. 
JSON gets passed into the resolve function.
IF ELSE same as TRY CATCH
## Day 4
If the function is part of an object we call it a method. method -> object.
A regular function not part of an object refrences is the glodbal object which is the window object in browsers global and node. function -> global (window,global,node.)
Constructor functions begins with capital letter and uses "new" and "this" keywords.
The word "this" will refrence a new empty object.
## Day 5
Can call functions on anyhing (examples: buttons, forms)
drop peramiters into objects {-}
Prototypes are abstracting codes.
everything in {-} is a object.
everything in (-) is a peramiter.
